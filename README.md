# cpcam
A bash script terminal utility to auto-sync between injected cam cards (e.g. photo, film) and local backup structures.

## Install instructions
All @diqidoq bash script utilities are build the same way: Create a ``` ~/share ``` and a ``` ~/bin ``` folder in you machines user account if it doesn't exist already (``` mkdir -p ~/<folder> ```) and ``` git clone ``` the repo into the ``` ~/share ``` folder. Then create a sym link from the main executable file commonly named like the repo in ``` ~/share/<the-new-utility-git> ``` to the ``` ~/bin/<executable> ``` folder and ``` chmod a+x ~/bin/<executable> ```. Make sure your ``` ~/bin ``` folder is in the system path (``` export PATH=/home/yourusername/bin:PATH ```) to make the new utility terminal aware for commands.
